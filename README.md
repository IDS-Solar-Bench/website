## NOTE
I just copied the folders from my testing folder straight into the repo without the node modules folders. Don't know how much that changes stuff or how you could go about installing the reqs.

### Running instructions

- Backend
1. Activate virtual environment in server folder: run .venv/Scripts/activate.bat on Windows, source .venv/bin/activate on Mac.
2. Run pip install flask and pip install flask-cors if needed (don't know if it will be)
3. Run file in virtual environment: py server.py

- Frontend
1. Maybe required to install packages before running. Open in a separate terminal.
